**Selenium**
- Selenium automates browsers.
- automating web applications for testing purposes.
- web-based administration tasks can be automated.

**Selenium WebDriver**
- A collection of language specific bindings to drive a browser.
- To create robust, browser-based regression automation suites and tests, scale and distribute scripts across many environments
- WebDriver drives a browser natively, as a user would, either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server.
- Selenium WebDriver refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code.
- Selenium WebDriver is a W3C Recommendation.
- WebDriver is designed as a simple and more concise programming interface.
- WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API.
- It drives the browser effectively.

**Selenium IDE**
- Open source record and playback test automation for the web
- A Chrome, Firefox and Edge add-on that will do simple record-and-playback of interactions with the browser.
- To create quick bug reproduction scripts
- Create scripts to aid in automation-aided exploratory testing
- Resilient Tests : Selenium IDE records multiple locators for each element it interacts with. If one locator fails during playback, the others will be tried until one is successful.
- Test Case Reuse : Through the use of the run command, you can re-use one test case inside of another (e.g., allowing you to re-use your login logic in multiple places throughout a suite).
- Control Flow: Selenium IDE ships with an extensive control flow structure, with available commands like if, while and times.
- Selenium IDE can be extended through the use of plugins. They can introduce new commands to the IDE or integrate with a third-party service. 

**Selenium Grid**
- To run tests in parallel across multiple machines.
- Selenium Grid allows the execution of WebDriver scripts on remote machines by routing commands sent by the client to remote browser instances.
- Allow testing on different browser versions
- Enable cross platform testing
